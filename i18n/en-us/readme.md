#### *"Copy&Distribute, not Move&Transact"*

## Introduction

Fishnet is a blockchain-less encrypted decentralized network and service suite.

Currently Fishnet is still in the early development stage and urgently needs more contributors to participate in development and research work.

## Development Status

Please refer to the README files in each subdirectory and the records in the GitHub Project tab.

## Join Fishnet!

After setting up a NixOS machine (virtual or physical), visit the [Fishnet Standard System page](https://github.com/Cynun/Fishnet-StandardSystem) and follow the instructions to get a Fishnet standard node!

However, nodes running in this way lack trust layer trust and network layer connections. If you wish to join Fishnet, please contact existing members to obtain an invitation and instructions.
