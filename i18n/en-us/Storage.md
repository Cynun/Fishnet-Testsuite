# About the Storage Layer
Storage - The Second Layer of Fishnet

## Decentralized Storage Services
Fishnet's storage is decentralized. Data is saved, replicated and distributed rather than actively deleted, transferred and owned.
Fishnet's development work is also stored here.

> Currently implemented using ipfs + bittorrent.
>
> This part is working and relatively stable.
>
> It requires no maintenance, and research on ipfs alternatives has low priority.
