# About the Service Layer
Services - The Fourth Layer of Fishnet

## Service Modes
There are two service modes:

1. Peer-to-peer Services:

    These are traditional services that rely entirely on address-to-address communication at the network layer using traditional TCP/UDP protocols.
    Virtual machines, web services, Matrix, etc. will be peer-to-peer services.

2. Decentralized Services:

    These are completely decentralized services, implemented by users making requests and updates to the entire storage and compute layers.

    This part is still in the early conceptual stage.
