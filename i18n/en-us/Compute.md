# About the Compute Layer
Decentralized Computing - The Third Layer of Fishnet

Since computing resources are relatively abundant in Fishnet, each node will participate in computation. This will be completely decentralized.

> The best implementation appears to be using HVM's computation graph for distributed computing, and ipfs's CoD for microservice/function call style computation.
>
> This part is far from being implemented.

> It has relatively low priority, as Fishnet will be multi-centralized rather than completely decentralized during its long early stages.
